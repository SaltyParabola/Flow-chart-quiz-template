# Flow-chart-quiz-template

I wanted to turn my flowchart into an interactive quiz but couldn't find a template like I wanted, so I made my own. I wanted each question/step to call the next question/step in order rather than having an overall skeleton function to determine the order of things. Having the more modular style seemed more sleek and easier to change the layout/order of. Each question/step in the flowchart is an object and the output field of each object is the name of the next object.

The function to run the quiz is very minimal, and as a last step it asks if you want to see the whole process. As the program runs, it records each step in a .txt file so you can see everything that needs to be done in a neater format without the questions making things messy.

# How to use

Download both files and put them in a folder together. Add your info to the flow_chart.py template for each step. From the terminal, run main.py. That's it! no dependencies, infinitely customizeable, runs on anything that runs python.

Feel free to use and customize this however you like.
